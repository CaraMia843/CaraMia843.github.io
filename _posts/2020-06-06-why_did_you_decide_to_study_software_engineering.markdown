  Why did I decide to study software engineering? Well, I have a genetic disorder that has destroyed most of my joints. I’m typing this on my bed desk inside my pillow nest. Not ideal for sure, but it works well enough. The past few years I’ve had to learn to be pretty creative with work-arounds to support my joints and be as comfortable as possible while still as functional as possible. It's been a journey.

  When I was 17 I tried college. Community college for a year before transferring to a small college in North Carolina. Around that time is when the symptoms of my genetic issues started to become more pronounced and interfered with everyday life. After a semester and a half in NC, I had to drop out and go home. Now, I wouldn’t be diagnosed until I was 32, so at the time everyone (including myself) thought I was just lazy and unmotivated. The emotional toll of those years is still very present in my life. 

  Around 6 years ago I started a job as an Executive Assistant for the CEO of a small business close to home. It was a remote position, which was wonderful, and my boss was supportive. I was promoted to Administrator and took over HR about a year or so in. It was a big raise in pay, but I had to go into the office everyday. During this time, I was also the office “IT” person. Which basically meant I had to figure out solutions to issues on my own. I taught myself how to build out our SaaS programs that were used to run the business. Thankfully, we had an actual IT guy that would come out for issues with the server or network. We would always chat while he was there and this is when I started to become interested in programming. 

  At the time, I was happy in my position and not thinking about another career change, but it was always in the back of my mind. I was there for almost 4 years before I had to go on disability. I just reached a point where I could no longer manage the two hours it took for me to get ready in the mornings, drive to work, be functional all day, and drive home. There was no life for me outside of work and my symptoms were not being managed. 

  I was able to buy a small house in West Virginia and I’ve been here since. A couple months ago, I started really researching different things I could do remotely for work. After some searching and false-starts, I found Flatiron School. Even the “bad” reviews from former students were good reviews, so I started the free bootcamp prep. Turns out I really enjoy it! After doing the prep I decided to just apply and see what happened, and here I am.

  Now, nearing the end of the First Mile I know so much more than I did a couple weeks ago. A couple weeks from now, I’ll know even more. Maybe a few years down the road I’ll actually figure out what I’m doing! No matter what happens over the next few months I won’t be giving up on learning, or on being able to comfortably support myself. I’m looking forward to what happens next.
